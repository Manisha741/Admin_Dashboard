In this project, I have made a interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard for what admin head wants to analysis on beverage consumption sales data and find some insights from the data. In order to building the dashboard Power query was used to clean and transform the data and DAX was used for creating the calculated measures and calculated column. Once done with the calculations, I have made visualizations and create report using drill down, mobile layout and tooltip etc.Which help to easy understanding of the end-user and give meaningful insights.
